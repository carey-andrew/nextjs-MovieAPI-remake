# nextjs-MovieAPI-remake

Why?
As an update to our week 3 bootcamp challenge to fetch and display data from an API, I decided to remake the website using Next.Js and React.
I wanted to challenge myself to include a search feature to learn more about how this can be integrated and I have also added a search by genre feature.

Challenges:
The search by genre feature was a challenge as I needed to combine two fetch requests from The Movie Database. One to return the genre names, then another to display the relevant film titles when a genre was clicked.

I also had to add a feature that reset the search and displayed the original tiles of genres to choose from. 

I have learnt more about how to organise my files into components and how Next 14 lets the pages and components work together. 


Still to complete- next steps are to be to look at the styling of the site and alter the behaviour of the search by word feature
